# Operating Instructions<br>

## Initial Startup<br>
When an unconfigured (new or fully reset) controller starts, it first offers a choice of which tip profile to use.<br>
Select the one appropriate for your iron. (JBC cartidges usually require electrical changes to the controller).<br>

- **Hakko T12** (T15 Series in North America & EU) This is the handle normally used with these controllers.<br>
- **JBC C210**<br>
- **JBC C245**<br>

## Basic Controls<br>
Changes are made using the rotary encoder and its push button.<br>
The power supply voltage is shown upper left, internal temperature in the upper right, bar graph of relative power going to the tip on the bottom.<br>
While in normal operation, shake sensor activity will be shown briefly in the top center.<br>
Otherwise, the current mode will be shown (sleep, standby, boost).<br>
To operate the menus, rotate to scroll to the desired selection, quick press to select it, rotate to change.<br>
Quick press again to stop editing the setting.<br>
Widgets have fine and coarse adjustment.<br>
While editing the widget, normal rotation will make fine adjustement. Click and rotate will do coarse adjustment.<br>

## Theory of Operation<br>
Before covering the settings, it is useful to understand how it works.<br>
Tip temperature is measured by using an ADC (Analog-Digital Converter) to measure the voltage output by a thermocouple in the tip.<br>
The voltage generated by the sensor is proportional to the difference between tip temperature and the "cold side" (Measured by the internal sensor).
The controller uses PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) to control the tip temperature.<br>
PWM basically varies the amount of time that the tip is powered.<br>
By default, PWM uses a 200 ms (5 times per second) period.<br>
If the tip is too hot, the controller will turn on power to the tip little or not at all during each cycle.<br>
If the tip is too cold, it will turn the power on for more of the period.<br>
The time the tip is powered on during each period is called the duty cycle.<br> 
<pre>
|<------ PWM PERIOD ------>|
| POWER |____ no power ____|
</pre>
The PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) algorithm determines the PWM duty cycle based on the difference between desired and measured tip temperatures.<br>

## Main screen<br>

  - **Temperature display modes**<br>
  While in run mode, a single click will switch between numeric and graph.<br>
  If the current mode is sleep/standby/boost, clicking will set run mode instead (If button wake is enabled).<br>
  Boost mode always exits on clicking, no matter the button configuration.<br>
  The graph update rate is the same as the ADC reading frequency.<br>
  - **Temperature setpoint adjustment**<br>
  Rotate the encoder, the setpoint will be shown, continue rotating to adjust it.<br>
  After 1 second of inactivity it will return to normal mode.<br>
  Click within this time to trigger boost mode.
- **Sleep/Standby modes**<br>
  You can manually enter lower power modes by clicking and rotating counter-clockwise.<br>
  The sequence would be [run/boost mode]->[standby mode]->[sleep mode].<br>
  If button wake is enabled, any encoder activity will resume normal mode. Othwerwise only the display brightness will be restored.<br>
  To wake up you can make a click (If button wake is enabled) or move the handle (If shake wake is enabled or in stand mode).<br>
- **Tip selection**<br>
  Click and rotate clockwise to show the tip selection.
  Click again to return, long-click enter the tip settings menu.<br>
  In any case, it will return to normal mode after 5 seconds of inactivity.<br>
- **System menu**<br>
  A long click will enter the system menu (Except while in tip selection/setpoint adjustment).<br>

## System menu<br>
Most screens will return to main screen after 15 seconds of inactivity.<br>
Long-clicking will have the same effect.<br>

### IRON

Iron settings control the operation of the handle/tips. <br>
  - **Max temp**<br>
Upper adjustable temperature limit.<br>
  - **Min temp**<br>
Lower adjustable temperature limit.<br>
  - **Boost time**<br>
Boost mode run time before resuming normal mode.<br>
  - **Boost temp**<br>
Temperature offset applied in boost mode. It's added to the current temperature and limited to system maximum temperature.<br>
  - **Standby time**<br>
If there is no soldering activity for this period, the controller will reduce the temperature to extend the tip life and reduce power waste.<br>
Setting this option to 0 will disable standby mode, the station will switch to sleep state.<br>
  - **Standby temp**<br>
Temperature applied in standby mode.<br>
  - **Sleep time**<br>
If there is no soldering activity for this period, the controller will "sleep" and stop providing power to the tip.<br>
This helps increase tip lifetime reduce power waste. Activity (e.g. shaking the handle for a T12) will wake it up and heating will resume.<br>
This timer cannot be disabled.<br>
  - **Power**<br>
The maximum power which will be delivered to the tip.<br>
The limit is done by adjusting the maximum PWM duty cycle based on the power supply voltage and the heater resistance.<br>
  - **Heater (resistance)**<br>
The resistance of the tip's heating element in ohms. There is normally no need to change this from the default.<br>
  - **ADC Time**<br>
Sets the ADC reading period. The controller stops disables the PWM and runs the ADC. Default 200 ms.<br>
It also sets the base PWM frequency. The PWM multiplier uses this base.<br>
  - **(ADC) Delay**<br>
When the temperature going to be measured, the PWM is disabled.<br>
This delay is needed to have a clean reading of the thermocouple. If the delay is too low, it will read switching noise and be very unstable.<br>
If you get random spikes in the temperature reading, try increasing this value. 20mS is usually more than enough.<br>
There are other factors that could cause unstability, like poor circuit design, power supply noise or bad quality parts.<br>
Default 20 ms.<br>
<pre>
    |<-------------- ADC TIME --------------->|
     ___     ___     ___|<-  DELAY  ->[ READ ] ___     ___    
PWM     |___|   |___|   |_____________________|   |___|   |___ 
</pre>
  - **PWM multiplier**<br>
Sets the PWM period, using the formula ADC Time/multiplier.<br>
Default: x1.<br>
  - **Filter**<br>
Adjust the filtering factor applied to the temperature measurements before they are passed to the PID.<br>
The value adjust the EMA (Exponential Moving Average) coefficient.<br>
This helps remove noise and provides more stability, but too high values will slow down the filter response and cause oscillation.<br>
  - **No iron**<br>
Sets the ADC reading threshold that detects when no iron is present.<br>
Usually when no iron is plugged in, the measured temperature will read at or close to maximum ADC range(4095).<br>
Values >4095 will disable "no iron" detection.<br>
Default 4000, max 4100.<br>
  - **No iron delay**<br>
Time in miliSeconds that an iron must be plugged in before it is considered present.<br>
If the screen bounces between run mode and no iron, increase this value.<br>
  - **Back**<br>
Return to system menu.<br>

### SYSTEM
General settings for the controller.<br>
  - **Profile**<br>
Sets which iron profile (__T12__, __C210__, __C245__) to use.<br>
  - **Contrast**<br>
Screen Contrast/brightness.<br>
  - **Auto dim**<br>
Fade the display after 10s in sleep or error modes to prevent display burning.<br>
  - **Offset**<br>
Screen offset. This can accomodate the different screens which the controllers have come with. Use it to center the display on the screen.<br>
  - **Wake mode**<br>
How to detect activity. SHAKE or STAND.<br>
SHAKE uses a motion sensor present in T12 handles, shake or hold the handle tip up to wake.<br>
STAND uses the same input, but disconnected from the handle. Must be shorted to gnd when the handle is in the stand.<br>
(Stand mode operation operation: Shorted to gnd = sleep/standby, open = run ).<br>
  - **Stand mode**<br>
Sets the mode that will be applied when the handle is put in the stand (sleep / standby).<br>
This option is disabled in shake mode.<br>
  - **Boot**<br>
Operation mode when powered on. __RUN__ or __SLEEP__.<br>
This option is disabled in stand mode.<br>
  - **Button Wake**<br>
Selects what modes can be waken with encoder activity.<br>
[None] [Standby only] [Sleep only] [All]<br>
This option is disabled in stand mode.<br>
  - **Shake Wake**<br>
Selects what modes can be waken with shake activity.<br>
[None] [Standby only] [Sleep only] [All]<br>
This option is disabled in stand mode.<br>
  - **Encoder**<br>
Invert the encoder direction.<br>
  - **Buzzer**<br>
	Buzz/beep when notable conditions occur.<br>
   	- Changing operating mode (sleep, standby, run, boost)<br>
   	- Temperature reached after the setpoint was changed<br>
   	- Alarm when no iron is detected or system error happens<br>
  - **Active detection**<br>
Use iron active detection by leaving the PWM slightly on all the time. If your amp has a pullup resistor it can be disabled.<br>
  - **Unit**<br>
Temperature scale. Celsius or Fahrenheit<br>
  - **Step**<br>
Temperature step when adjusting tip temperature.<br>
 - **Big Step**<br>
Temperature Big step when adjusting tip temperature, click and rotate to activate big step in temperature screen<br>
Temperature Big step is also enabled when rotating the encoder fast.
  - **LVP**<br>
Adjust Low voltage protection.<br>
  - **GUI Time**<br>
To offer maximum responsiveness, the screen is updated as fastest as possible when the cpu is idling.<br>
It depends on the MCU used and display interface, it can reach more than 100 fps in DMA SPI mode.<br>
If the display readings were updated at the same speed, it would be impossible to read anything.<br>
This setting defines the time in mS where the main screen readings are updated (voltage, temperatures).<br>
The effective update rate will be limited by the ADC read frequency.<br> 
Use a higher setting for less "flickery" display (more steady values).<br>
  - **RESET MENU**<br>

    - **Pull resistance**<br>
    - **NTC resistance**<br>
    - **NTC beta**<br>
  - **SW:**<br>
Displays the current software version. Actually, it's the build date.<br>
  - **HW:**<br>
Displays the controller model.<br>
  - **Back**<br>
Return to system menu.<br>

### EDIT TIPS
Different tips may have different characteristics. Tips may be added or edited here.<br>
Select a tip to enter tip settings edit screen, or select Add New to create a new tip.<br>
The new tip will be created by copying the PID/calibration settings from the first in the system.<br>

### EDIT TIP SETTINGS
This menu allows Tip name editing, copying, deleting, PID tuning and adjustment of stored tip calibration values.<br>
PID tuning is an advanced topic, _**incorrect settings here can result in instability and damage to tips and possibly the controller**_.<br>
Most users should not change these settings, but here are the basics. Kp, Ki, Kd, Imax, Imin are the coefficients which control the PID's behavior.<br>
Calibration values are not meant for manual adjustment. Only to restore a previous calibration result.<br>
Use calibration for optimal results.<br>
  - **TIP NAME**<br>
Shows the tip name, click on it to edit the name.<br>
  - **PID Kp**<br> 
The proportional term, changes the PWM duty cycle based on how far the measured temperature is from the desired temperature.<br>
  - **PID Ki**<br>
The integral term, changes the duty cycle based on how long the temperatures have been different.<br>
  - **PID Kd**<br>
PID differential term, changes the duty cycle based on how fast the measured temperature has changed.<br>
  - **PID Imax**<br>
The integral accumulator higher limit.<br>
  - **PID Imin**<br>
The integral accumulator lower limit.<br>
  - **Cal250**<br>
The stored value for 250ºC calibration.<br>
  - **Cal350**<br>
The stored value for 350ºC calibration.<br>
  - **Cal450**<br>
The stored value for 450ºC calibration.<br>
  - **SAVE**<br>
Save the tip settings.<br>
This option will be disabled if the tip name is empty or already exists.<br>
  - **COPY**<br>
Copy this tip into a new slot.<br>
This option will be disabled if already copying the tip or when there are no free slots left.<br>
  - **DELETE**<br>
Delete the current tip.<br>
This option will be disabled if already copying the tip or when there's only one tip in the system.<br>
  - **CANCEL**<br>
Discard any changes and return.<br>

---

### CALIBRATION
  - **START**<br>
Requires a tip thermometer (e.g. Hakko FG-100 or similar). Calibrates the current tip at temperatures of 250, 350 and 450°C.<br>
Wait for tip temperature to settle (When the thermomether reading stops moving), it can take up to 20 seconds in some cases.<br>
Then enter temperature as measured by the thermometer for each step.<br>
If the entered temperature is higher than 50ºC than the target calibration value, the process will be aborted and you will have to adjust it manually.<br>
  - **SETTINGS**<br>
Here you can manually adjust the default calibration values.<br>
For every step (250,350,450ºC), adjust the value until the tip temperature it's close to the target temperature.<br>
The power is removed in this menu. When editing a value, the power is resumed and the value applied in real time.<br>
This is an adjustment made to avoid burning the tip in the calibration process if your controller reading are too low from real.<br> 
This values have nothing to do with the Tip Settings calibration values! (Those are temperature-compensated).<br>
Click on save to apply and store the changes, or cancel to discard.<br> 
  - **BACK**<br>
Return to system menu.<br>

### PID DEBUG
This is a menu to help debugging the PID.<br>
The 3 plots are:<br>
- PID current proportional value.<br>
- PID current integral value.<br>
- PID current derivative value.<br>

A click or long-click will exit this screen.<br>

---

### ERROR REPORTING
A lot of effort was done to protect the tips from overheating.<br>
Any detected error will disable PWM and show a message on the display.<br>
To recover from an error, simply press the button and it will reboot.<br>
There are multiple error types:<br>
  - **Iron warning**<br>
For non critical errors, a warning will be shown: iron not detected, supply voltage too low, ambient temperature too high or too low, failsafe mode enabled.<br>
  - **Iron runaway**<br>
If by any means the iron temperature is higher than requested and the system is still powering the tip, it will trigger a timer depending on the temperature diference.<br>
The condition must dissapear within the specified time, otherwise it will trigger a critical runaway error, shutting down the power stage.<br>
This is very useful to protect the tip from wrong PID adjustemnts (Ex. excessive Imax values).<br>
  - **Internal function errors**<br>
If any internal function detects an undefined or not expected state, it will lock the station and show a message trying to show where the error happened (File, line).<br>
  - **Hardware exceptions**<br>
If a hardware exception happens, the station will lock up and display an error message about the exception.<br>
  - **Data error detection**<br>
The data is stored as separate blocks: System settings, profile 1(T12), profile 2(C245) and profile 3(C210).<br>
Each one has it's own CRC checksum. When a block is read, the checksum is computed and compared.<br>
If a mismatch occurs, the block will be erased and resetted to defaults, trying to preserve the rest of the data.<br>
An error will be shown, detailing if the error detected was on the system settings data, or in any of the profiles.<br>
Also, the flash storage is checked carefully before and after writes, any issue will trigger a flash error message.<br>
  
 ### HARD RESET
If for any reason the station is unable to boot, you can't access the reset menu or you want to wipe everything up quickly, there's a hard reset method.<br>
Power the station off, push and hold the endcoder button, and then power the station on.<br>
A message will appear in the screen. "Hold button to restore defaults".<br>
Keep pressing the button for another 5 seconds, until the next message appears, "Release button now".
Release the button, the station will wipe everything and reboot.<br>

If you accidentally pushed the button, just release it before the 5 second timeout to resume the boot process.
