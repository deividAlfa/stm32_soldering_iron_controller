<a id="Details"></a>
## Project details
* This project started by forking [PTDreamer's firmware](https://github.com/PTDreamer/stm32_soldering_iron_controller). Since then it became a separate project.
* Developed on STM32Cube IDE. Basic configuration is easily done in CubeMx (Included in STM32Cube IDE).
* Unified codebase, different hardware support based on profiles, very few files need to be changed.
* Supports all display modes: I2C, SPI, software and hardware+DMA (When connected to hardware pins).
* Uses u8g2 graphics library. 
* Dynamic screen loading to save RAM resources.
* Extremely customizable, lots of options available.
* Code highly optimized to avoid wasting cpu power, slow devices still run great.

## Compatibility

The actual requirements are 10KB RAM and 64KB **(\*)** flash.<br>
**(\*)** Currently the firmware has surpassed the 64KB limit, and uses the additional undocumented 64KB flash block.<br>
**(\*)** All 64KB devices have 128KB, with the 2nd 64KB block untested from the factory, so not guaranteed to work.<br>
**(\*)** To date, I have found zero issues. Original KSGER firmware also does this.<br>
**(\*)** ST-Link checks the written data, and the firmware uses checksums to protect the settings, any error will be detected.<br>

The [BOARDS](https://github.com/deividAlfa/stm32_soldering_iron_controller/tree/master/BOARDS) folder has the board code profile, schematics and/or board pictures for quickly identify your hardware.<br>
Currently supported controllers (Click to download the latest build):<br>
* [**Quicko T12-072**](https://github.com/deividAlfa/stm32_soldering_iron_controller/raw/master/BOARDS/Quicko/STM32F072/STM32SolderingStation.bin): For STM32F072 variant.
* [**Quicko T12-103**](https://github.com/deividAlfa/stm32_soldering_iron_controller/raw/master/BOARDS/Quicko/STM32F103/STM32SolderingStation.bin): For STM32F103 variant.
* [**KSGER v1.5**](https://github.com/deividAlfa/stm32_soldering_iron_controller/raw/master/BOARDS/KSGER/%5Bv1.5%5D/STM32SolderingStation.bin): Profile for STM32F103 (There are no other known CPUs used in this board).
* [**KSGER v2.x**, **JCD T12**, **QUECOO T12-955**](https://github.com/deividAlfa/stm32_soldering_iron_controller/raw/master/BOARDS/KSGER/%5Bv2%5D/STM32SolderingStation.bin): Profile compatible with all STM32F101/2/3xx models.
* [**KSGER v3.x**](https://github.com/deividAlfa/stm32_soldering_iron_controller/raw/master/BOARDS/KSGER/%5Bv3%5D/STM32SolderingStation.bin): Profile compatible with all STM32F101/2/3xx models.


Actually, the easiest way to quickly identify your KGSER version is by looking at the Oled screen connection:<br>
- **4 pin** (I2C) = v2.x<br>
- **6 pin** (SPI) = v3.x<br>

Also keep in mind that you can't trust the version shown in the original firmware to identify your board.<br>
Go to [BOARDS](https://github.com/deividAlfa/stm32_soldering_iron_controller/tree/master/BOARDS)/... schematics folder and compare the pictures.<br>
There are several compatible/cloned boards in the market that will work fine with Ksger profiles.<br>

## Frequently asked questions<br>

First, make sure to read the [Operating instructions](Readme_files/Operation.md)!<br>

 
### Changelog<br>
You can check the [commit history](https://github.com/deividAlfa/stm32_soldering_iron_controller/commits/master) to see what have been changed between builds.

### Backing up the original firmware
The original firmwares are available [[HERE]](https://github.com/deividAlfa/stm32_soldering_iron_controller/tree/master/Original_FW)<br>
Some KSGER firmwares require an activation code which can be generated [[HERE]](http://t12.omegahg.com/keygen.htm)  [[Alternative link]](https://rawcdn.githack.com/deividAlfa/stm32_soldering_iron_controller/60457394b0b8e8db893a42d745f81979e225e161/Original_FW/KSGER/Gen/gen.htm)<br>

Be warned, usually the MCU will be read-protected, so you won't be able to read its contents, only erase it.<br> 
The simplest way to not loose the original FW is actually to buy a new MCU, replace it, and store the original MCU in a safe place.<br>
Any difference in the pinout will require firmware tuning, although one of the main proposits of this firmware is easing that.<br>
There are some hacks / vulnerabilities that can be used to backup protected firmware, more details here:<br>
**[STM32 power glitching timing attack](https://github.com/dreamcat4/t12-t245-controllers-docs/tree/master/tools/software/STM32CubeIDE#option-2-power-glitching-timing-attack
)**<br>

### Flashing the firmware
There's no support for custom bootloaders.<br>
Use one of these ST-LINK clones ($3 or less), refer to the schematics for the SWD pinout.<br>

Download the binary **STM32SolderingStation.bin** already compiled from the [BOARDS](https://github.com/deividAlfa/stm32_soldering_iron_controller/tree/master/BOARDS) folder and flash it using stlink.<br>
Follow this pictures to update the firmware without erasing the stored settings.<br>
Important: STM32F072 has 2KB flash sector size, so only de-select the last sector.<br>
(Click for bigger picture)<br>
<img src="/Readme_files/stlink_erase.png?raw=true"><br>
<img src="/Readme_files/stlink_program.png?raw=true"><br>

In any case, the firmware will check the settings and reset them if not valid.<br>

### Display issues<br>
If the display has right/left line like this picture: Go to [System menu](Readme_files/Operation.md#system) / Offset and adjust the value until it's centered.<br>
<img src="/Readme_files/oled_offset.jpg?raw=true" width="320"><br>

### Temperature unstability<br>
By default, never modify any PWM / Delay settings in the [Iron menu](Readme_files/Operation.md#menu). Doing so may cause such issues.<br>
Also, new tips are often unstable, leading to temperature jumps.<br>
Don't try to calibrate the tip in this state, neither set a high temperature, because it could go under control.<br>
They usually settle after some burning time. It's recommended to set a medium temperature (250-300ÂºC) and leave like that for 15-20 minutes until it stabilizes.<br>
If the temps are still unstable, try increasing the Iron/Delay option, allowing more time for the temp signal to settle.<br>
A damaged, loose or defective connection in the handle will also cause this issues. Ensure the contacts are clean.<br>
There have been problems with some board/stations like:<br>
* Noisy power supply
* Broken / badly soldered capacitors
* Bad Op-Amp
* Bad 3v3 Regulator

### Temperature accuracy
Buying a cheap high temperature meter is highly recommended!<br>
These boards can have pretty different readings and tolerances. Even between T12 tips.<br>
So the factory calibration is intentionally set lower than real, to avoid possible overheating problems.<br>
Once you set the firmware, go to calibration and set there the real temperature measured with the external probe.<br>

### Calibration issues<br>
Ensure to read [Calibration menu](Readme_files/Operation.md#calibration) first!.<br>
To calibrate, go into Calibration / Start.<br>
Attach the temperature probe before proceeding!<br>
If the difference between measured and real is higher than 50ÂºC, the calibration will be aborted, telling you to go into Calibration / Settings and manually adjust the values.<br>
The calibration settings menu has 3 calibration steps: Zero set, 250 and 400Â°C.<br>
When you edit 250/400ÂºC value, the power will be enabled and the value applied in real time, so be careful!<br>
The power will be removed when no settings are being edited.<br>
Adjust each value until it's close to the target temperature. Repeat for each step and save.<br>
This values are only used by the calibration process, to prevent burning the tip if your board reads too low.<br>
After adjusting, repeat calibration, this time it should work correctly.<br>
The calibration results for the current tip can be seen in the tip settings menu.<br>
Tip settings menu calibration values aren't meant to be another calibration menu, only for viewing (Ex. reporting calibration results) and for backup/restore purposes.<br>
In the case you lose, wipe or reset the data, you can go back into that menu and adjust the values based on previous calibration results.<br>
Zero calibration can't be manually restored, but it only takes few seconds to adjust.<br>

### Cold tip not showing ambient temperature
Some amplifiers can introduce a small voltage offset that will translate into the cold tip reading 30-50Â°C higher than ambient temperature.<br>
To fix that, enter the [Calibration menu](Readme_files/Operation.md#calibration), insert a completely cold tip, enter Settings, adjust Zero set calibration and save.<br>
After that, the offset will be compensated and the cold temperature will be normal.<br>
It's highly recommended to recalibrate after changing this value.<br>

### Other issues<br>
After fully reading the documentation, if you still have problems or doubts, please ask in the EEVblog thread:<br>

## Building the firmware

Video of building steps:<br>
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT](http://img.youtube.com/vi/8oeGVSSxudk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oeGVSSxudk "Firmware build")

If you use an existing project template and modify it, the changes must be reflected in /Core/Inc/board.h.<br>
All the project code takes the data from there. The file it's pretty much self-explaining.<br>
So, any changes you make in CubeMX, ex. use PWM timer6 intead timer2, or SPI1 instead SPI2...all that should be configured in their respective define.<br>
As long as the GPIO names are called the same way, no further changes are needed.<br>

If you want to build your own, clone or download the source.<br>
The source is stripped from ST own libraries and unnecesary stuff, only includes the very basic code owning to the project.<br>
CubeMX will add the STM32 and CMSIS libraries automatically after a code generation.<br>
Open the [BOARDS](https://github.com/deividAlfa/stm32_soldering_iron_controller/tree/master/BOARDS) folder, find your board (or take any to work with) and copy all the contents to the root of the project.<br>
Now you're ready to open STM32CUBE IDE and import the project.<br>
Open the .ioc file,  make any small change, ex. take an unused pin and set is as GPIO_Input, then revert it to reset state.<br>
This will trigger the code generation. Close saving changes and the code will be generated. And it's ready for building.<br>
CubeMX should care of adding the new folders to the search path, if it fails follow this steps.<br>
Right click on project -> Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings ->  Tool Settings -> MCU GCC Compiler -> Include paths<br>
On the upper menu, Configuration, Select [All configurations]<br>
Click on Add... Select Workspace and select these folder while holding Control key:<br>
Ensure these are present:<br>

      /Core/Inc
      /Core/Src
      /Drivers/generalIO
      /Drivers/graphics
      /Drivers/graphics/gui
      /Drivers/graphics/gui/screens    
      /Drivers/graphics/u8g2
      /Drivers/STM32Fxxx_HAL_Driver/Inc
      /Drivers/STM32Fxxx_HAL_Driver/Inc/Legacy
      /Drivers/CMSIS/Device/ST/STM32Fxxx/Include
      /Drivers/CMSIS/Include
      
(STM32Fxxx matches your current mcu family, ex. STM32F0xx, STM32F1xx)<br>
<img src="/Readme_files/Includes.jpg?raw=true">


Click in the right arrow of the build button (Hammer icon), select Release, then click on the build button and should build right away.<br>
<img src="/Readme_files/release.jpg?raw=true">

At some point, the firmware might not fit into the flash when compiling for debugging, as it'll skip optimizations, and use much more space.<br>
In that case, you'll need to force some optimization level, starting with "Optimize for debug" (Og), and going to higher levels if still being too big (O1,O2,Osize).<br>
The settings can be changed in project Properties / Build / Settings / MCU GCC Compiler / Optimizations.<br>
However, when debugging, it's desirable to completely disable optimizations to see the program flow clearly.<br>
If you had to enable any level of global optimizations, you can still selectively disable build optimizations for any function.<br>
A line of code can be found at the start of main.h:<br>

  __attribute__((optimize("O0")))

Copy that line before a function to disable optimization, like this:<br>

   __attribute__((optimize("O0"))) void ThisFunctionWillNotBeOptimized(...)
   

If you want to retarget the project, avoid mixing different profile files.<br>
Run the included script "Clean_Profile.bat", or manually delete these files:<br>

    /Core/Inc/*stm32*
    /Core/Src/*stm32*
    /Core/Src/system_stm32*
    /Core/Startup/*

And then copy the board profile files overwriting any existing files.<br>

### Non working features
* I2C eeprom. Some boards have it, some doesn't. So internal flash storage is used for all.<br>
Also, the current settings don't fit in the commonly used 24C08 memory.<br>
* RTC clock. There's very little space in the screen. Use it for what matters, instead for showing a clock!
